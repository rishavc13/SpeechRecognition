# GuessTheWord

This mini project employs Socket Programming and Speech Recognition as well as TTS techniques. Hence appropriate modules have been used.
The client.py file is run at the client side and the server.py file is run at the server side.
The project is a sort of game where the person at the server side has to guess the word selected by the used at the client side.
The client side user gives a voice input to select one word from a pred-defined list of words.
The server side user then has 3 chances to guess the word right by giving input through speech. The word given as input through speech is recognized by using Speech Recognition module in Python.
